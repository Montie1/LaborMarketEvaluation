Labor Market Evaluation

-As you get closer to choosing which pathway you’d like to pursue for the rest of the course,
(Data Analysis with Python, Software Development with C#, or Web Development with JavaScript),
 you’ll complete a Labor Market Evaluation to help determine which path may best fit your interests and career goals. 

-In addition to conducting your own research, you will also attend a “Choose your Pathway” workshop 
to get more information as you make your final decision.



1.Define each of the three pathways (Data Analysis, Software Development, and Web Development) in your own words. 

2.Provide a link to an open job for each of the three pathways.
Please also list the company and job title with the URL in case the link expires before our team is able to review your submission. 

3.List what technical and transferable skills you currently possess that would be useful 
for each of the positions you shared above.


4.With the information you've gathered so far, which pathway are you leaning toward pursuing and why?

Note: You'll make your official choice after the pathways workshop 
(and will have a chance to ask our staff questions regarding the options), 

but we want you to start thinking about it ahead of time!
